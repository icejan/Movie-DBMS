The online movie store

## Features
allows people to search for their favorite movies with multiple filtering options based on genres, year released, director, and other criteria. 
The online store will enable people to buy or rent movies. 
The employee can add, remove, and modify the digital movie entries, as well as customer table entries. 
The employee can add, remove or manage its movie metadata specifically genres, release date, actors, directors, etc.
A customer will have attributes like email, password, billing address, and payment info. They can search the database for movies they might be interested in purchasing by specifying a title, genre, or associated performers and directors. Upon selection of a desired movie title, the price will be displayed. 
Payment will be completed by charging the saved credit card on file before the user has access to the movie. Upon successful payment, a timestamp will be added to the customerâ€™s film to keep track of both purchase history and remaining rental time left if applicable.

## GUI Application
The application for this project was written in .net C#. This simple program allows the user to explore the database system, allowing for records to be added, modified, or deleted. To the right is an image of the main window that the user can interact with.
